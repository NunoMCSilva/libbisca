# TODO

- Add TODOs written elsewhere (out of dir)
- use tox instead of pipenv in .travis.yml (see interactions...)
- check why build doesn't rebuild even after files have been changed...
- clean examples.py
- check if examples.py would fit in setup.py (may need to go to another directory)
- check tox: correct versions of libs to install -- issue? (or just remove that from pipenv)
